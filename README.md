# Udacity Project - Memory Game

The idea is to use Javascript to build a version of the memory game.

I have taken this opportunity to take on board some of the workflow lessons to create
a modern workflow.

## Project dependencies

In building my workflow I have compiled a list of all the dependencies that are used in order to create a fast efficient and optimised workflow.

**Global dependencies**
- gulp [x]
- sass [x]
- eslint [ ]

**Development Dependencies**
- gulp-sass [x]
- autoprefixer [x]
- browserSync [x]

**Production Optimisations**
- gulp-concat (for JS)
- gulp-minify
- source maps for JS

Modify the sass task to output a compressed file
Use gulp Babel
